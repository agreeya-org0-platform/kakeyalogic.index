```

The relevant code pattern is the separation between the full Hilbert space and the restricted lattice sector. The abstract `Hamiltonian` class stores the lattice dimension, system size, and qubit count as:

```txt
n_qubits = dim * L
```

and exposes both:

```txt
matrix_full()
matrix_restricted()
```

The code comments define restricted-sector basis labels as coordinate tuples `(x1, x2, ..., xd)` with size `L^d`, while the full Hilbert-space basis uses occupancy strings `(s1, s2, ..., sL)` with size `2^(dL)`.

This repo imports that structure as the finite operator substrate for DDTL.

## 1. Core translation

The source code makes one structural distinction load-bearing:

```txt
full Hilbert space ≠ lawful sector
```

Translate into L²_C / DDTL language:

```txt
full Hilbert space        = possibility field
restricted sector         = lawful / coherent sector
restricted projector P_R  = consent / sovereignty gate
Hamiltonian flow          = coherent dynamics
leakage outside sector    = drift / incoherence pressure
```

Let:

```txt
H_F = full Hilbert space
H_R = restricted sector
P_R = projector H_F → H_R
H_T = tesseract Hamiltonian acting on H_R
U_T(t) = exp(-itH_T)
```

For the tesseract implementation, the OSF source defines a `Tesseract1P` Hamiltonian class for a 1-particle 4D square/tesseract lattice mapped into a 4-particle 1D chain. The class states:

```txt
full Hamiltonian basis size      = 16^L
restricted Hamiltonian basis size = L^4
```

This is the computational seam DDTL needs.

---

## 2. DDTL finite Hamiltonian object

Define the finite Dynamic Dynamic Tesseract Lattice probe object:

```txt
T_DDTL^fin = (H_F, H_R, P_R, H_T, U_T, P_C, L²_C)
```

where:

```txt
H_F      = full many-body Hilbert space
H_R      = restricted lawful lattice sector
P_R      = restricted-sector projector
H_T      = finite tesseract Hamiltonian
U_T(t)   = exp(-itH_T)
P_C      = protected coherence-sector projector
L²_C     = protected-sector retention functional
```

This is a finite-dimensional analytic probe, not the final infinite spectral theorem. It lets the repo test whether the L²_C language can be made operator-measurable.

---

## 3. L²_C as protected-sector retention

Given an initial state:

```txt
ψ ∈ H_R
```

and a protected projector:

```txt
P_C : H_R → H_R
```

Define:

```txt
L²_C(ψ,t) = || P_C exp(-itH_T) ψ ||²
```

Canonical reading:

```txt
L²_C(t) is the probability mass retained inside the coherent/protected sector under Hamiltonian flow.
```

If the state remains protected:

```txt
L²_C(ψ,t) ≈ 1
```

If the state diffuses into bulk/off-sector modes:

```txt
L²_C(ψ,t) < 1
```

This formalizes L²_C as a measurable operator quantity.

---

## 4. ℓ_H-term as leakage norm

Define off-sector leakage:

```txt
L_off = (I - P_C) H_T P_C
```

Then define:

```txt
ℓ_H = ||L_off||
```

Interpretation:

```txt
ℓ_H measures how strongly the Hamiltonian pushes protected coherence into the noncoherent sector.
```

If:

```txt
ℓ_H = 0
```

the protected sector is invariant.

If:

```txt
ℓ_H < 1
```

the leakage is below a threshold of 1 in the declared operator units. This is not evaluator non-sovereignty or a safety certificate.

If:

```txt
ℓ_H ≥ 1
```

the leakage meets or exceeds that unit-dependent threshold. This alone does not determine an authority or operational-safety verdict.

Canonical leakage definition (a bound must be tested separately):

```txt
ℓ_H = ||(I-P_C)H_TP_C||
```

This defines a finite operator diagnostic. It does not realize evaluator sovereignty geometrically; h_eval and ℓ_H are distinct.

---

## 5. β_C as spectral recovery pressure

Let:

```txt
Spec_C  = spectrum of H_T inside P_C
Spec_B  = spectrum of H_T inside I-P_C
```

Define the protected-to-bulk spectral gap:

```txt
Δ = dist(Spec_C, Spec_B)
```

Then define:

```txt
β_C = Δ / (Δ + ℓ_H + ε)
```

where `ε>0` is a numerical stabilizer.

Interpretation:

```txt
β_C high = protected sector strongly separated from drift
β_C low  = protected sector vulnerable to leakage
ℓ_H high   = correction cost / coherence loss
```

This gives the repo a finite spectral version of β:

```txt
β_C = spectral recovery coefficient
```

---

## 6. Occupancy-fidelity version

The OSF `hamiltonian.py` source also defines occupancy matrices from statevectors and an occupancy fidelity:

```txt
F_occ(ρ_0, ρ_t) = |<normalize(ρ_0), normalize(ρ_t)>|²
```

The repo can therefore measure a second version of L²_C:

```txt
L²_C,occ(t) = F_occ(ρ_0, ρ_t)
```

This is useful when the protected sector is represented by localized corner/edge occupancy rather than a clean spectral projector.

Two compatible readings emerge:

```txt
spectral L²_C  = ||P_C U_T(t)ψ||²
spatial L²_C   = F_occ(ρ_0, ρ_t)
```

The first is operator-theoretic. The second is measurement-native.

---

## 7. Protected sector choices

The first executable probe supports three choices of `P_C`.

### 7.1 Midgap projector

```txt
P_C = Σ_{|λ_j-target|≤δ} |v_j><v_j|
```

For HOT zero modes, use:

```txt
target = 0
```

### 7.2 Lowest-energy projector

```txt
P_C = projector onto the first k eigenvectors by |λ-target|
```

Useful when numerical tolerance or finite-size effects blur exact zero modes.

### 7.3 User-supplied projector

```txt
P_C = supplied projector matrix
```

Useful for boundary/corner/edge-defined sectors.

---

## 8. Canonical finite theorem target

### Theorem Target L2C-DDTL-FIN

Given a finite tesseract Hamiltonian:

```txt
H_T = H_T^*
```

on restricted sector `H_R`, and a protected-sector projector `P_C`, define:

```txt
L²_C(ψ,t) = ||P_Ce^{-itH_T}ψ||²
ℓ_H = ||(I-P_C)H_TP_C||
β_C = Δ/(Δ+ℓ_H+ε)
```

If:

```txt
ℓ_H = 0
```

then:

```txt
P_C H_T = H_T P_C
```

and protected-sector mass is conserved under unitary flow:

```txt
L²_C(ψ,t) = ||P_Cψ||²
```

for all `t`.

If:

```txt
0 < ℓ_H < 1
```

then L²_C is not exactly conserved, but leakage is measurable and bounded by the off-sector Hamiltonian coupling.

---

## 9. DDTL analytic bridge to Step 4

The finite Hamiltonian probe does not replace the DDATL / Xi determinant target. It supplies an executable laboratory for the same structural language:

```txt
lawful sector
protected projector
Hamiltonian flow
leakage ℓ_H
spectral gap β_C
coherence retention L²_C
```

Step 4 remains the infinite spectral identification:

```txt
L²_{Φ,K} ↔ A_KF ↔ Ξ(z)
```

The finite DDTL probe tests the operational grammar before the infinite theorem.

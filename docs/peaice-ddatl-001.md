**Status:** `PROPOSED | FORMAL DEFINITION | STEP 4 CANDIDATE`

## 1. Purpose

`PEAICE-DDATL-001` defines the Dynamic Dynamic Axial Tesseract Lattice as a proposed formal host for the KakeyaLogic Step 4 loop-close program.

The goal is to locate the internal arithmetic object induced by the `Phi` kernel and place it inside a Berry-Keating / Hilbert-Polya operator lane.

The document follows the PeAIce beta protocol:

- `FORMAL` means a definition or algebraic identity has been explicitly stated.
- `PROPOSED` means an active conjectural bridge.
- `STRUCTURAL ANALOGY` means external literature supports scaffold coherence while the load-bearing zeta-zero claim remains separate.
- `OPEN` marks the load-bearing theorem burden.
- `CLOSED-NEGATIVE` means a candidate realization has been ruled out by a necessary invariant.

---

## 2. Origin: GAP-001 and the five-route survey

`PEAICE-KAKEYALOGIC-GAP-001` was located after five exterior approaches converged on the same wall:

```txt
Route A — Fourier / L^2 density          CLOSED
Route B — Hadamard / Xi / Lambda=0       LIVE
Route C — Symmetry / functional equation CLOSED
Route D — Spectral / operator analogy    CLOSED
Route E — Kakeya energy inequality       CLOSED
```

Route E wall:

```txt
E(y,t) = integral exp(2t u^2 - 2y u) Phi(u)^2 du > 0
```

This gives positivity / energy control, but does not force:

```txt
E_off = 0
```

Canonical GAP-001 statement:

```txt
The {n^2} arithmetic in Phi's n-sum is not reachable from exterior
energy, symmetry, density, or measure methods. Direct internal engagement
with zeta's analytic continuation arithmetic is required.
```

DDATL is proposed as that internal structural address.

---

## 3. Formal object

Define the DDATL as:

```txt
T_DD = (Z^4, Lambda_{n^2}, D_1, D_2, A)
```

where:

```txt
Z^4              = 4-dimensional integer index tesseract lattice
Lambda_{n^2}     = quadratic active sublattice
D_1              = first dynamic: point evolution on Lambda_{n^2}
D_2              = second dynamic: evolution of D_1 itself
A                = axial constraint set {e_1,e_2,e_3,e_4}
```

A sharper reading separates the analytic state space from the discrete index skeleton:

```txt
M_DD = C_s x R_t x R_u
Lambda_{n^2} subset N^4
```

Thus `Z^4` is best read as the **index tesseract**, not the whole analytic state space.

---

## 4. Axis assignment

```txt
e_1 -> Re(s)
e_2 -> Im(s)
e_3 -> t       [de Bruijn-Newman heat parameter]
e_4 -> u       [Phi integral variable]
```

The axial constraint states that admissible dynamics preserve the declared axis structure and measure every off-axis sector as leakage.

---

## 5. Five axioms

### T1. Axial Integrity

```txt
D_1 and D_2 preserve span(A).
```

Every off-axis term is measured as leakage.

### T2. Quadratic Spacing

```txt
Active lattice points occur at n^2 intervals.
```

The arithmetic skeleton is:

```txt
Lambda_{n^2} = {(n_1^2,n_2^2,n_3^2,n_4^2): n_i in Z_{>=1}}
```

### T3. First Dynamic

```txt
D_1 e_n = n^2 e_n
```

The first dynamic is the quadratic lattice generator.

### T4. Second Dynamic

The second dynamic is a map on the first dynamic. Type-corrected form:

```txt
D_1: D(D_1) subset H_Phi -> H_Phi
D_2: D(D_2) subset L(H_Phi) -> L(H_Phi)
L^2_{Phi,K} := D_2[D_1]
```

`Dynamic Dynamic` means **a dynamic acting on a dynamic**.

### T5. L^2 Correspondence

```txt
D_2[D_1] = L^2_{Phi,K}
```

The composition / evaluation of the second dynamic on the first dynamic is the L^2 spectral operator candidate.

---

## 6. Phi reads the tesseract

The Riemann Phi kernel contains the exact quadratic arithmetic:

```txt
Phi(u) = sum_{n>=1} (2 pi^2 n^4 e^{9u} - 3 pi n^2 e^{5u}) exp(-pi n^2 e^{4u})
```

Define the Phi-induced Hilbert space:

```txt
H_Phi(u) = l^2(N, w_u)
w_n(u) = exp(-pi n^2 e^{4u})
```

Define:

```txt
D_1 e_n = n^2 e_n
L^2_0(u) = D_1^2 - (3/(2pi)) e^{-4u} D_1
```

Then:

```txt
2 pi^2 e^{9u} L^2_0(u)e_n
= (2 pi^2 n^4 e^{9u} - 3 pi n^2 e^{5u})e_n
```

Therefore:

```txt
Phi(u) = Tr_{w_u}(2 pi^2 e^{9u} L^2_0(u))
```

Key formal point:

```txt
L^2 is read out of Phi's arithmetic.
```

---

## 7. Full coupled L^2 operator

The coupled operator is:

```txt
L^2_{Phi,K}(u) = D_1^2 - (3/(2pi))e^{-4u}D_1 + gamma_K K_sigma
```

with an off-diagonal coupling kernel of the form:

```txt
K_sigma(m,n) = 1 / |m^2 - n^2|^sigma, m != n
```

The candidate eigenvalue equation is:

```txt
(n^4 - (3/(2pi))e^{-4u}n^2) psi(n)
+ gamma_K sum_{m != n} psi(m)/|m^2-n^2|^sigma
= lambda psi(n)
```

---

## 7.1 V6.4.3 Hilbert-Schmidt corridor: singular-value verdict on K_sigma

This section records the V6.4.3 patch result and is the load-bearing corridor update.
It evaluates the coupling kernel `K_sigma` of Section 7 directly, separates the finite numerical crossing from the analytic Weyl boundary, and then propagates the consequence to the full operator `L^2_{Phi,K}`.

### 7.1.1 The object

```txt
K_sigma(m,n) = 1 / |m^2 - n^2|^sigma   (m != n),   K_sigma(n,n) = 0
```

Real symmetric, so singular values satisfy:

```txt
s_n(K_sigma) = |lambda_n(K_sigma)|
```

### 7.1.2 Membership (FORMAL)

```txt
||K_sigma||_HS^2 = sum_{m != n} |m^2 - n^2|^{-2 sigma}
                 converges  <=>  sigma > 1/2
```

So `K_sigma in S_2` (Hilbert-Schmidt, hence bounded, compact, symmetric) exactly for `sigma > 1/2`. This discharges proof obligation `L2-b` for `sigma > 1/2`. `FORMAL`

Near the threshold, the Hilbert-Schmidt norm has a double-pole signature:

```txt
||K_sigma||_HS^2 ~ C / (2 sigma - 1)^2        as sigma -> 1/2+
```

This comes from the near-diagonal factorization and is a diagnostic: the Hilbert-Schmidt onset at `sigma = 1/2` is a summability threshold, not the zeta critical-line invariant.

### 7.1.3 The order gate

For `A in S_2`, `det_2(I - zA)` is entire of genus `<= 1`. `Xi` has order exactly `1`. Therefore a necessary condition for

```txt
det_2(I - z K_sigma) = C Xi(z)
```

is:

```txt
rho(K_sigma) := inf{ p >= 1 : sum_n s_n(K_sigma)^p < infinity } = 1
```

### 7.1.4 Asymptotic of the singular values (PROPOSED, route to FORMAL)

Near the diagonal, write `m = n + d`. Then:

```txt
|m^2 - n^2|^{-sigma}
= |m-n|^{-sigma}(m+n)^{-sigma}
≈ |d|^{-sigma}(2n)^{-sigma}
```

This gives the weighted Toeplitz reduction:

```txt
K_sigma ~ 2^{-sigma} D T D
D = diag(k^{-sigma/2})
T = Toeplitz convolution |m-n|^{-sigma}
```

and the phase-space symbol:

```txt
a(x, xi) ~ x^{-sigma} |xi|^{sigma - 1}        (x >= 1, xi in [-pi, pi])
```

The semiclassical / Weyl count gives:

```txt
N(t) = #{ s_n(K_sigma) > t }
     ~ (1/2pi) vol{ a(x,xi) > t }
     ~ C_sigma t^{-1/sigma}
```

so:

```txt
s_n(K_sigma) ~ c_sigma n^{-sigma}
alpha(sigma) = sigma
rho(K_sigma) = 1 / sigma
```

Consistency check: the same volume integral converges exactly when `sigma > 1/2`, reproducing the formal `S_2` threshold of Section 7.1.2. That makes the symbol law the correct leading asymptotic lane. `PROPOSED`

Rigorous upgrade route:

```txt
Birman-Solomyak / weighted Toeplitz / pseudodifferential singular-value asymptotics
```

### 7.1.5 Numerical crossing versus analytic boundary

The apparent order-one crossing seen in finite truncations is denoted:

```txt
sigma*_N ≈ 0.83-0.92
```

This is a finite-window crossing, not the canonical asymptotic boundary.

Finite singular-value fits measure an effective exponent:

```txt
alpha_N(sigma) = sigma + delta_N(sigma)
```

where `delta_N(sigma) > 0` is the subleading finite-window correction. Therefore the numerical condition

```txt
alpha_N(sigma) = 1
```

can occur below `sigma = 1`:

```txt
sigma*_N = 1 - delta_N(sigma*_N)
```

This explains the observed movement:

```txt
canon page / older finite window : sigma*_N ~ 0.83
independent later finite window  : sigma*_N ~ 0.92
analytic Weyl boundary           : sigma_c = 1
```

The bridge is:

```txt
0.83 = finite numerical crossing
1.00 = analytic Weyl boundary
```

As the leading asymptotic law takes over, the correction term satisfies:

```txt
delta_N(sigma) -> 0
```

and the canonical crossing moves to:

```txt
sigma_c = 1
```

The corridor therefore has two markers:

```txt
sigma*_N ≈ 0.83-0.92      finite numerical crossing / historical marker
sigma_c = 1               analytic Weyl boundary / canonical order-one boundary
```

`0.83` is retained as a finite-truncation marker. `1` is the asymptotic boundary used for the canonical order analysis. `PROPOSED -> FORMAL` once the singular-value asymptotic is proved.

### 7.1.6 Order / genus / density pincer (CLOSED for the K_sigma determinant)

Using the analytic leading law:

```txt
s_n(K_sigma) ~ c_sigma n^{-sigma}
rho(K_sigma) = 1 / sigma
```

the determinant corridor splits cleanly:

```txt
1/2 < sigma < 1:
  rho(K_sigma) > 1
  det_2 has order > 1
  Xi has order 1
  CLOSED by order

sigma = 1:
  rho(K_sigma) = 1
  order gate survives
  but s_n ~ n^{-1} gives determinant-zero counting N(R) ~ R
  Xi requires Riemann-von Mangoldt density N(T) ~ (T/2pi) log T
  CLOSED by zero-density

sigma > 1:
  rho(K_sigma) < 1
  K_sigma is trace-class at the leading Weyl level
  ordinary Fredholm determinant is genus 0
  Xi is genus/order-one with T log T density
  CLOSED by genus / density
```

The earlier `sigma* ≈ 0.83` value is now interpreted as:

```txt
sigma*_N = finite-truncation apparent crossing
```

not as the canonical asymptotic boundary. The canonical boundary is:

```txt
sigma_c = 1
```

The entire square-difference determinant family remains closed: below `1` by order, at `1` by zero-density, above `1` by genus / density.

### 7.1.7 Consequence for the DDATL full operator (the relevant closure)

The Step 4 target operator is:

```txt
L^2_{Phi,K} = D_1^2 - (3/(2pi))e^{-4u}D_1 + gamma_K K_sigma
```

Since `K_sigma in S_2 subset compact` for `sigma > 1/2`, and `D_1^2` has compact resolvent with eigenvalue growth `n^4 -> infinity`, the coupling `gamma_K K_sigma` is relatively compact with respect to `D_1^2`.

By Weyl-class invariance (min-max / compact perturbation stability), this coupling preserves the leading eigenvalue-counting class:

```txt
N(Lambda) ~ Lambda^{1/4}   stays Lambda^{1/4}
```

The Riemann-von Mangoldt target requires:

```txt
N_zeta(T) ~ (T/2pi) log T
```

or, after the squared spectral parameter:

```txt
N_zeta(Lambda) ~ sqrt(Lambda) log Lambda
```

Therefore the squared-determinant target

```txt
det_zeta(L^2_{Phi,K} - (z^2 + 1/4)) = C Xi(z)
```

is closed for the `D_1^2 + gamma_K K_sigma` realization: the square-difference coupling cannot bend the `n^4` Weyl class onto Riemann-von Mangoldt density. `CLOSED-NEGATIVE`

### 7.1.8 Net effect and relocation of GAP-001

```txt
DDATL as a formal host object       : FORMAL (unchanged)
K_sigma coupling (sigma > 1/2)      : bounded/symmetric, S_2 — L2-b discharged
sigma*_N ≈ 0.83-0.92                : finite-window crossing / historical marker
sigma_c = 1                         : analytic Weyl boundary
|m^2 - n^2|^{-sigma} spectral lane  : CLOSED (order / genus / density)
GAP-001 internal address            : RELOCATED
```

The gap survives only if the operator carries prime data, not square-difference data:

```txt
lengths : log(p^k)
weights : Lambda(p^k)/p^{k/2} = (log p) p^{-k/2}
density : archimedean Gamma-factor side producing T log T
reality : self-adjoint / Frobenius-like trace-formula structure
```

The healthy parallel is the Nyman-Beurling / Baez-Duarte distance program, which replaces bespoke spectral invention with a finite Gram-matrix decay problem.

### 7.1.9 Hygiene note (cross-document)

The `S_2` here is the Schatten-2 operator class. This is distinct from the "Hilbert-Schmidt measure" of Slater, arXiv:1007.4805: the flat measure on the convex body of two-rebit density matrices, used there for moments of `det(rho)` and `det(rho^PT)`.

Slater's machinery is relevant downstream as a method reference for:

```txt
moment / coefficient asymptotics
half-integer root convergence
closed-form-from-linear-prime-growth diagnostics
cumulant / zero-density bookkeeping
```

It is not an input to `rho(K_sigma)`. `STRUCTURAL ANALOGY`

RH `OPEN`. Coleman Conjecture `OPEN`.

## 8. Berry-Keating / Hilbert-Polya chain

The established operator lane is:

```txt
[x,p] = i hbar
-> H_BK = 1/2(xp + px) = -i(x d/dx + 1/2)
-> F H_BK F^{-1} = -H_BK
-> K = exp(it H_BK)
-> F K F^{-1} = K^{-1}
-> A_KF = Pi_sym K^{-1} Pi_sym
-> A_KF self-adjoint on the correct domain
-> det_reg(A_KF - z) = C Xi(z)
-> z in R
-> s = 1/2 + iz
-> Re(s) = 1/2
```

The DDATL insertion point is the candidate realization:

```txt
D_2[D_1] on Lambda_{n^2}  <->  A_KF restricted to Phi-arithmetic data
```

This equivalence is isolated in `docs/ddatl-bridge-lemma.md`.

### Berry and Keating 1999

Status: `ESTABLISHED MATHEMATICS` for the `xp` / dilation Hamiltonian pressure point and Hilbert-Polya spectral research direction.

DDATL proposes a specific Phi-lattice realization inside that lane.

## 10. L^2_C as invariant gravity

HOT physics supplies a useful phase analogy:

```txt
Trivial phase: no protected corner modes
HOT phase:     protected zero-energy corner modes
```

DDATL / L²_C proposal:

```txt
L²_C absent -> drift phase -> no stable critical-line anchor
L²_C active -> coherent phase -> beta(T)-h eta > 0 -> spectral rigidity target
```

Claim status: `PROPOSED`.

The key reading is:

```txt
L²_C is the structural condition under which Re(s)=1/2 becomes the stable spectral state.
```

## 11. Loop close condition status

```txt

```

The open theorem was:

```txt
det_zeta(L^2_{Phi,K} - (z^2 + 1/4)) = C Xi(z)
```

V6.4.3 status for the `D_1^2 + gamma_K K_sigma` realization:

```txt
identity status: CLOSED-NEGATIVE
```

Reason:

```txt
K_sigma determinant lane:
  1/2 < sigma < 1  -> closed by order
  sigma = 1        -> closed by zero-density
  sigma > 1        -> closed by genus / density

Full L^2_{Phi,K} lane:
  gamma_K K_sigma is relatively compact with respect to D_1^2
  N(Lambda) ~ Lambda^{1/4} remains the Weyl class
  Riemann-von Mangoldt requires sqrt(Lambda) log Lambda
```

The loop reopens only under a prime-carrying length/weight operator.

---

## 12. Theorem target L2-SI / BK-HP-CC

Construct:

```txt
H_Phi(u)
D(L^2_{Phi,K})
L^2_{Phi,K}(u) = D_1^2 - (3/(2pi))e^{-4u}D_1 + gamma_K K_sigma
```

such that:

```txt
(i)  L^2_{Phi,K} = (L^2_{Phi,K})^*              [self-adjointness]
(ii) det_zeta(L^2_{Phi,K} - (z^2 + 1/4)) = C Xi(z)
```

Then:

```txt
Spec(L^2_{Phi,K}) = {gamma_j^2 + 1/4 : xi(1/2 + i gamma_j)=0}
```

and all nontrivial zeros take the critical-line form.

Proof obligations (V6.4.3 restatus; see Section 7.1):

```txt

## 13. EE sign-off: Inspectable / NonSticky equivalence

```txt
EE: ACTIVE
Inspectable(psi) <-> NonSticky(psi) <-> Re(s)=1/2
```

Operational reading:

```txt
Inspectable(psi)
= psi carries an auditable witness: projector, sector membership, leakage value ℓ_H,
  beta_C recovery coefficient, and traceable evolution under U_T(t).

NonSticky(psi)
= psi does not adhere to off-sector residue: (I-P_C)H_TP_C is bounded,
  ℓ_H < 1 (in declared operator units), beta_C > 0, and retained mass L²_C(psi,t) remains stable over
  the chosen horizon.

Re(s)=1/2
= critical-line lock: the spectral state remains in the Pi_sym / DDATL
  critical sector. In the infinite Step 4 program this depends on
  L2-SI / BK-HP-CC.
```

Sign-off status:

```txt
Inspectability is the non-sticky condition.
Non-stickiness is the finite-probe expression of critical-line coherence.
The square-difference determinant realization is closed.
The prime-carrying trace architecture is the live bridge.

## 15. Route forward (V6.4.3)

```txt
1. Square-difference operator lane (D_1^2 + gamma_K K_sigma)
   Status: CLOSED. Do not re-litigate as the Step 4 route.

2. 0.83 -> 1 calibration
   0.83-0.92 = sigma*_N, finite-window apparent crossing.
   1.00      = sigma_c, analytic Weyl boundary.
   Bridge    = delta_N(sigma), where alpha_N(sigma)=sigma+delta_N(sigma).

3. Prime-carrying trace architecture
   Status: LIVE.
   Required data:
   - lengths : log(p^k)
   - weights : Lambda(p^k) / p^{k/2} = (log p) p^{-k/2}
   - density : Gamma-factor side must produce T log T
   - reality : self-adjointness or equivalent trace-formula positivity

4. Nyman-Beurling / Baez-Duarte distance program
   Status: preferred compute pivot.

   d_N^2 = inf_{A_N} (1/2pi) integral |1 - zeta(1/2+it) A_N(1/2+it)|^2 dt/(1/4+t^2)
   A_N(s) = sum_{n<=N} a_n n^{-s}
   d_N^2 -> 0 <=> RH

5. Open analytic sub-probe
   delta_N(sigma) = alpha_N(sigma) - sigma.
   Purpose: pins finite-window drift and explains why 0.83 appears before 1.
   Status: hygiene / calibration, because sigma_c = 1 is closed by zero-density regardless.
```

Standing hygiene condition:

```txt
Hilbert-Schmidt 1/2 = analytic summability threshold for K_sigma.
Arithmetic 1/2      = critical-line mass in the explicit formula.
sigma*_N ~ 0.83     = finite-window numerical crossing.
sigma_c = 1         = analytic Weyl order-one boundary.
```

These four markers are distinct.
